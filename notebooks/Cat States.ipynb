    "# Non-Deterministic Preparation of Cat States\n",
    "\n",
    "Cat states are of quantum states of the form $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes w}+|1\\rangle^{\\otimes w}$ which have various application in quantum error correction, most famously in Shor-style syndrome extraction where a weight-$w$ stabilizer on a code is measured by performing a transversal CNOT from the support of the stabilizer to a cat state. The difficulty of cat states comes from the fact that it is hard to prepare them in a fault-tolerant manner. If we use cat states for syndrome extraction we want them to be as high-quality as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Fault-tolerant Preparation Circuit\n",
    "A cat state can be prepared by preparing one (arbitrary) qubit in the $|+\\rangle$ state and the remaining $w-1$ in the $|0\\rangle$ state and then entangle the $|+\\rangle$ state with the remaining qubits via CNOT gates. The exact pattern is of these CNOTs is not too important. We just have to make sure that the entanglement spreads to every qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do it is by arranging the CNOTs as a perfect balanced binary tree which prepares the state in $\\log_2{w}$ depth. Let's define a noisy stim_circuit that does this."
