Analog Information Decoding
===========================
This submodule provides means to conduct decoding simulations for quantum CSS codes with
analog syndrome information as proposed in the corresponding paper :cite:labelpar:`berent2023analog`.
Proper integration and setup is a work in progress.
The main functionality is provided in the :code:`simulators` module, which contains the main classes
that can be used to conduct several types of simulations:

- :code:`ATD_Simulator`: Analog Tanner graph decoding,
- :code:`Single-Shot Simulator`: Analog Single-Shot decoding with meta checks.
- :code:`QSS_Simulator`: Quasi-Single-Shot decoding, and

Moreover, :code:`memory_experiment` contains methods for analog overlapping window decoding, in
particular the :code:`decode_multiround` method.

Results
-------
The :code:`results` directory contains the results used in the paper :cite:labelpar:`berent2023analog`.

Codes
-----

The :code:`codes` directory contains the parity-check matrices of the codes used in the paper :cite:labelpar:`berent2023analog`.
Three dimensional toric codes can either be constructed with the hypergraph product construction
or with a library, e.g., panqec :cite:labelpar:`huang2023panceq`.

Code construction
-----------------

The :code:`code_construction` directory contains the code used to construct higher-dimensional hypergraph
product codes and used the :code:`compute_distances.sh` script to automatically compute bounds on the
distances of the constructed codes using the GAP library QDistRnd :cite:labelpar:`pryadko2023qdistrnd`.

Utils
-----
Here we present an overview of the functionality of the utils package.

Plotting
++++++++
The :code:`plotting` directory contains the code used to plot the results in the paper :cite:labelpar:`berent2023analog`.

Data Utils
++++++++++

We have implemented several utility functions as part of this package that might be of independent
interest for decoding simulations and data analysis. These are provided in the :code:`data_utils` module.

Simulation Utils
++++++++++++++++
This module contains functionality needed throughout different simulation types.

Dependencies
++++++++++++

The used BP+OSD implementation, as well as our implementation of the soft-syndrome minimum-sum decoder are provided
in the ldpc2 package a preliminary beta version of which is available on github :cite:labelpar:`roffe2023ldpc`.
