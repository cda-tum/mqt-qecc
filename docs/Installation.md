# Installation

We highly recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for working with Python projects.
It is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust and developed by [Astral](https://astral.sh/) (the same team behind [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)).
It can act as a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `virtualenv`, and provides a more modern and faster alternative to the traditional Python package management tools.
It automatically handles the creation of virtual environments and the installation of packages, and is much faster than `pip`.
Additionally, it can even set up Python for you if it is not installed yet.

If you do not have `uv` installed yet, you can install it via:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} macOS and Linux

```console
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Windows

```console
$ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Check out their excellent [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for more information.

## Integrating MQT QECC into your project

If you want to use the MQT QECC Python package in your own project, you can simply add it as a dependency in your `pyproject.toml` file.
This will automatically install the MQT QECC package when your project is installed.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} uv _(recommended)_

```console
$ uv add mqt.qecc
```

:::

:::{tab-item} pyproject.toml

```toml
[project]
# ...
dependencies = ["mqt.qecc>=2.0.0"]
# ...
```
