    "For a $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer code we can check for X- and Z-errors with transversal CNOTs using a single $2n$ ancilla state. Half the qubits are then used as the control in a transversal CNOT and the other half as the target of another transversal CNOT. To ensure that these applications of CNOTs don't disturb the logical state we have to make sure the stabilizers propagate correctly from the state to the ancilla and vice-versa. \n",

Furthermore, let $S_X = \\{X^{\\otimes H_X[i, :]} \\mid 1 \\leq i \\leq (n-k)$ where $X^{\\otimes v}$ is the stabilizer that acts as a Pauli $X$ on qubit $j$ if $v[j] = 1$ and as identity otherwise. $S_Z$ is defined analogous.\n",
